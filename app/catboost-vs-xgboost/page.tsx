          , which utilized CatBoost to enhance trading strategies with AI. In
          this post, we'll compare CatBoost with XGBoost, two popular gradient
          boosting algorithms, to help you understand their differences and
          decide which might be better for your trading strategies.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Both CatBoost and XGBoost are powerful tools for enhancing trading
          strategies with AI. The choice between them depends on the nature of
          your data and the specific requirements of your strategy. CatBoost's
          ease of use with categorical data and robust performance makes it a
          strong candidate for many applications, as demonstrated in our
          FreqaiExampleHybridStrategy. Meanwhile, XGBoost's speed and
          flexibility continue to make it a popular choice for various machine
          learning tasks.
