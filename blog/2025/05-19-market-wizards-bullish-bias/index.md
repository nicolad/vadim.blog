2025 is a cognitive trap for equity bulls. The Ukraine front barely moves, President Trump’s blanket 10 % tariff rattles importers, and German GDP just printed –0.6 % QoQ—yet the S&P 500 hovers north of 5 500.  
If that disconnect feels _comfortable_, your built-in **bullish bias** (the reflex that “prices _should_ rise”) is probably steering the wheel.

Below you’ll find the **fully annotated** 30-question audit that the original _Market Wizards_ might run if they sat at your terminal today. Each line now includes:

- **Wizard Insight** – the lesson Schwager’s interviewees hammered home.
- **2025 Angle** – why the trap is live right now.
- **Real-World Example** – an actual 2025 tape or trade vignette.

Paste the checklist into your trading journal, sprint through one block per week, and watch your P/L detach from hope-fuelled drift.

## 1 Self-Diagnosis & Mind-Set

| #     | Question                             | Wizard Insight                                                      | 2025 Angle                                                                       | Real-World Example                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Do you scan for longs first?         | Mark Cook forced students to open a _bearish_ filter before coffee. | All major U.S. broker dashboards open on “Top Gainers.”                          | 11 Mar 2025: NVDA +6 % headlined your grid; bottom losers list showed LUMN –13 % (a better 2-R short you never saw). |
| **2** | 5 % drop—curiosity or dip euphoria?  | Paul Tudor Jones cut leverage 50 % within minutes on 19 Oct 1987.   | 15 Mar 2025: SPX –5.1 %, VIX 34 → index kept sliding another –2 % before basing. | You felt “great entry” and bought QQQ, stopped out –1 R next day.                                                    |
| **3** | Does shorting feel “un-American”?    | Tom Baldwin joked “The pits only cheer the upside.”                 | Media framed every 2024 sell-off as “unpatriotic betting.”                       | You posted a bearish tweet on Apple and got piled-on for “fighting innovation.”                                      |
| **4** | Dips = noise, rallies = trends?      | Ed Seykota logged only % risk and ATR multiples—no adjectives.      | CNBC still calls –2 % a “slump” but +2 % a “rally.”                              | 23 Apr 2025 journal: “just a blip lower” (SPX –1.8 %), “solid up-trend” (+1.6 %).                                    |
| **5** | Is self-worth tied to rising curves? | Seykota kept family money in T-Bills.                               | Real college costs +6 % YoY; equity drift no longer guarantees coverage.         | You increased size after your kid’s tuition invoice hit inbox.                                                       |

## 2 Historical Perspective & Narrative Traps

| #      | Question                              | Wizard Insight                                     | 2025 Angle                                       | Real-World Example                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **6**  | How did you fare in each mini-crash?  | Jones was green in ’87; Raschke flat in ’98.       | 2022 bear (–27 %) still on broker statement.     | Your 2022 curve: –18 % vs CTA index +13 %.              |
| **7**  | Tested your edge with drift = 0?      | Seykota’s systems worked on pork bellies—no drift. | Forward SPX drift est. < 4 %.                    | Your momentum back-test Sharpe fell from 1.2 ➜ 0.48.    |
| **8**  | Rely on “Don’t bet against America”?  | Kovner warns empires rotate.                       | Proposed 2 % buy-back tax in House bill HR-1735. | Removing buy-backs in DCF knocked 7 turns off Apple PE. |
| **9**  | Ignoring survivorship in Wizard lore? | Schwager himself says thousands blew up.           | TikTok “profit porn” hides losers.               | Your Telegram group shares only green screenshots.      |
| **10** | Studied markets that never bounced?   | Japanese believers held Nikkei bags for 34 yrs.    | Greek ASE –85 % from ’07 peak even now.          | Your Europe ETF overweight assumes 7 % CAGR.            |

## 3 Quantitative Evidence

| #      | Question                        | Wizard Insight                                        | 2025 Angle                                                | Real-World Example                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **11** | Shorts share of tickets & P/L?  | Cook: “Trade both sides or half your vision is gone.” | Q1-25 had strongest 3-day down-impulse since Covid lows.  | 9 shorts out of 112 trades; net P/L –2 R.                  |
| **12** | Invert your long signal—result? | Seykota’s “whipsaw song” works both ways.             | High-short-interest anomaly revived with expensive rates. | Inverted signal on same universe scored Sharpe 0.32.       |
| **13** | Price vs log-return testing?    | Wizards think in % risk.                              | Nasdaq 100 raw-point rise masks compounding.              | Strategy CAGR fell from 18 % ➜ 11 % in log mode.           |
| **14** | Stop symmetry?                  | Raschke: 2 ATR both sides.                            | Meme squeezes tempt 1 ATR shorts, 3 ATR longs.            | Last month: 6 short stop-outs at –1 ATR, 2 long at –3 ATR. |
| **15** | Monte-Carlo μ = 0 survival?     | Jones funds vol desks to weather drift drought.       | Commodity volatility doubles path risk now.               | 10 000 paths: median curve flatlines by month 22.          |

## 4 Risk & Capital Allocation

| #      | Question                          | Wizard Insight                                  | 2025 Angle                                       | Real-World Example                                         |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **16** | Exposure cap symmetric?           | Seykota could flip net ±200 %.                  | Short borrow fees sub-1 % for 80 % of S&P names. | You allow +150 % long, –25 % short.                        |
| **17** | Averaging down losers?            | Kovner: “Losers average losers.”                | AI chip names drop 18 % intraday regularly.      | Added twice to AMD at –3 % and –6 %; closed –2 R.          |
| **18** | Cover shorts first in vol spikes? | Tudor held shorts through crash until vol bled. | Post-VIX-34 drift negative for 12 sessions.      | Closed TSLA short on spike, kept long tech—lost 1.4 R.     |
| **19** | Put hedge value?                  | Jones buys vol only when skew cheap.            | 1-month ATM put cost 1.8 % in Mar 2025.          | Last year: spent 3.4 R in premium, saved 1.1 R in crashes. |
| **20** | Squeezes breach worst-case loss?  | Baldwin sized by dollar vol.                    | Feb 2025 GME +40 % gap.                          | Short lost 2.3 R overnight.                                |

## 5 Process & Decision Architecture

| #      | Question                         | Wizard Insight                       | 2025 Angle                                                     | Real-World Example                                               |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **21** | UI bias toward gainers?          | Seykota coded neutral dash.          | Broker UIs show green first.                                   | Missed FSLY –12 % fail because list buried.                      |
| **22** | Short checklist depth?           | Raschke rehearses shorts like longs. | Easier borrows post-reg changes.                               | Long checklist 12 items; short only 5.                           |
| **23** | Narrative only for shorts?       | Wizards trust price.                 | News calls every dip an “overreaction.”                        | Skipped META short for lack of “fundamental story”; missed –8 %. |
| **24** | Post-mortem balance?             | Cook logs every miss.                | Feb 2025: three perfect failed-break short signals unreviewed. | Reviewed 7 missed longs, 0 shorts.                               |
| **25** | Auto-flip after failed breakout? | “Failed move = fast move” —Soros.    | AI names fake breakouts weekly.                                | Long NVDA fake-out –1 R, no flip; price dropped another 4 %.     |

## 6 Psychology & Continuous Improvement

| #      | Question                       | Wizard Insight                    | 2025 Angle                                 | Real-World Example                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **26** | Bias tags clustering on longs? | Jones hired risk coach.           | AI tools auto-tag sentiment now.           | 65 % optimism tags on long entries, 15 % on shorts.      |
| **27** | Real-time beta alerts?         | Tudor’s board lit red at β > 0.7. | Slack webhooks trivial.                    | Hit 0.78 beta on 9 Apr, noticed next day.                |
| **28** | Gap-down rehearsal?            | Basso ran crash sims monthly.     | Turkey ETF gap –12 % overnight, Feb 2025.  | Panicked exit + slippage –1 R; never rehearsed scenario. |
| **29** | Forced-flat longs feeling?     | Seykota welcomes dry powder.      | Broker outage flushed longs 14 Jan.        | Felt panic → identity fusion with bull thesis.           |
| **30** | Preparing for lower drift?     | Wizards add new edges.            | Demographics & reshoring compress margins. | Equity CAGR model still at 8 %.                          |

## 7 Wrap-Up

Bullish bias survives because it _pays_ most of the time—until it erases years of gains in a single macro grenade.  
The _Market Wizards_ neutralised the bias through **symmetry**: equal screens, stops, reviews, and above all, equal respect for up and down tape.

Run this playbook once per quarter:

1. **Audit** each question honestly.
2. **Patch** the weakest habit or policy.
3. **Re-test** your edge in a zero-drift simulation.

Do that, and the next tariff volley, energy spike, or AI bubble unwind becomes just another tradeable regime—not a career-ending ambush.

_Happy (bias-free) trading!_
