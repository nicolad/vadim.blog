## Introduction

Algorithmic trading is transforming the financial landscape, and frameworks like [**VeighNa**](https://github.com/vnpy/vnpy) combined with **Interactive Brokers (IB)** offer traders the tools they need to optimize their trading strategies and automate execution across global markets. However, setting up these tools on **macOS**, particularly on Apple Silicon (M1/M2), can be tricky due to package compatibility issues. This guide will walk you through the installation process of VeighNa with IB on macOS, highlighting all the potential **gotchas** we encountered, along with their solutions.

## Why VeighNa and Interactive Brokers?

- **VeighNa** is a Python-based open-source quantitative trading framework, designed to integrate with multiple data sources and trading platforms. It allows traders to automate trading strategies across various asset classes with ease.
- **Interactive Brokers (IB)** is a popular broker for algorithmic traders due to its low fees and extensive market access. The IB API provides robust tools for executing trades and gathering market data in real-time.

By integrating **VeighNa** with IB, traders can build powerful and flexible algorithmic trading systems.

## Installation Guide for macOS

### Step 1: System Requirements

Before starting the installation, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **macOS**: Big Sur (11.0) or later
- **Python**: Version 3.10 is recommended
- **Homebrew**: A package manager for macOS
  - If you don't have Homebrew, install it by running:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

### Step 2: Installing Python

VeighNa works best with **Python 3.10**, as newer versions (e.g., Python 3.11+) can have compatibility issues with some libraries.

1. **Install pyenv** to manage Python versions:

   ```bash
   brew install pyenv
   ```

2. **Install Python 3.10.10** using pyenv:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.10.10
   ```

3. **Set Python 3.10.10 as your global Python version**:
   ```bash
   pyenv global 3.10.10
   ```

> **Gotcha #1**: We faced issues with Python 3.11 due to package incompatibilities, especially with **PySide6** and **ta-lib**. Sticking with Python 3.10 resolved these problems.

### Step 3: Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment isolates dependencies and avoids conflicts with other projects.

1. **Create the virtual environment** using pyenv:

   ```bash
   pyenv virtualenv 3.10.10 veighna_env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   pyenv activate veighna_env
   ```

### Step 4: Cloning VeighNa and Installing Dependencies

1. **Clone the VeighNa repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paperswithbacktest/vnpy.git
   cd vnpy
   ```

2. **Install VeighNaâ€™s required libraries** using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Gotcha #2**: While installing dependencies, the **ta-lib** library often causes build errors on macOS, especially on M1/M2 chips. Make sure to install **ta-lib** via Homebrew first:
>
> ```bash
> brew install ta-lib
> export TA_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ta-lib/include
> export TA_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ta-lib/lib
> ```

> **Gotcha #3**: We also faced issues with **PySide6** for GUI rendering. Explicitly install a compatible version:
>
> ```bash
> pip install PySide6==6.3.0
> ```

### Step 5: Installing Interactive Brokers API (ibapi)

To integrate VeighNa with Interactive Brokers, you need to install **ibapi**, the official IB API client library.

1. **Install the Interactive Brokers API**:

   ```bash
   pip install ibapi
   ```

2. **Verify the installation** by importing `ibapi` in Python:
   ```bash
   python
   >>> from ibapi.client import EClient
   ```

> **Gotcha #4**: If you get a **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ibapi'"**, ensure that **ibapi** is correctly installed in the virtual environment. Also, check if the virtual environment is activated.

### Step 6: Configuring VeighNa to Work with Interactive Brokers

To connect VeighNa to IB, you need to configure the **IbGateway** within your VeighNa setup.

1. **Enable API Access** in Interactive Brokers' TWS (Trader Workstation) or IB Gateway:

   - In **TWS** or **IB Gateway**, navigate to **Settings** > **API** > **Settings**.
   - Enable **"Allow connections from localhost"** and **"Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients"**.

2. **Configure VeighNa to use IB Gateway** by modifying the gateway configuration in the code:

   ```python
   from vnpy_ib import IbGateway
   from vnpy.trader.ui import MainWindow, create_qapp
   from vnpy.event import EventEngine
   from vnpy.trader.engine import MainEngine

   def main():
       qapp = create_qapp()
       event_engine = EventEngine()
       main_engine = MainEngine(event_engine)

       main_engine.add_gateway(IbGateway)
       main_window = MainWindow(main_engine, event_engine)
       main_window.showMaximized()

       qapp.exec()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

### Step 7: Running VeighNa Trader with Interactive Brokers

Run your VeighNa Trader with IB Gateway integration using the following command:

```bash
python3 examples/veighna_trader/run_execution.py
```

> **Gotcha #5**: You might encounter errors related to **Product.CFD** not being found in the IB configuration. To resolve this, manually add the missing product in your code:
>
> ```python
> from vnpy.trader.constant import Product
> Product.CFD = "CFD"
> ```

### Step 8: Troubleshooting Common Errors

#### 1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ibapi'**

This error occurs if the **ibapi** package is not installed in your virtual environment. Reinstall the package:

```bash
pip install ibapi
```

#### 2. **AttributeError: 'Product' object has no attribute 'CFD'**

This means the **CFD** product type is not defined in the **IbGateway**. You can resolve it by adding this to your code:

```python
from vnpy.trader.constant import Product
Product.CFD = "CFD"
```

#### 3. **ta-lib Build Errors**

When installing **ta-lib**, if you encounter build errors, ensure the correct paths for **ta-lib** are exported:

```bash
export TA_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ta-lib/include
export TA_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ta-lib/lib
```

#### 4. **ZSH: bad interpreter: No such file or directory**

This happens if your virtual environment points to a missing Python version (after switching Python versions). To fix it:

- Remove the broken environment:
  ```bash
  rm -rf veighna_env
  ```
- Recreate it with the correct Python version:
  ```bash
  pyenv virtualenv 3.10.10 veighna_env
  pyenv activate veighna_env
  ```
