## Overview of the Error

### What Is the "No Security Definition" Error?

When interfacing with Interactive Brokers (IB) through platforms like VeighNa, each security must be precisely defined with the correct attributes. The error:

```
ERROR:root:Error - ReqId: 1, Code: 200, Message: No security definition has been found for the request
```

indicates that IB could not recognize the security based on the provided contract details. This typically stems from:

- **Incorrect Exchange Code**: Using an exchange code that IB does not recognize for the given security.
- **Unsupported Security Type**: Specifying a product type that doesn't align with the security.
- **Malformed Symbol Format**: Not adhering to IB's symbol formatting rules.

### Importance of Correct Exchange Mapping

Accurate exchange mapping ensures that:

- **Orders and Data Requests**: Are directed to the correct exchange, facilitating proper execution and data retrieval.
- **Error Prevention**: Minimizes the likelihood of encountering errors related to unrecognized securities.
- **Efficient Trading**: Enhances the reliability and performance of your trading algorithms.

### Error Flow Diagram

## Implementing Correct Exchange Mapping

To resolve the exchange mapping issue, follow these steps:

### 1. Verify IB Symbol Rules

Ensure that the symbol format aligns with IB's requirements. For example:

- **Stocks**: `SYMBOL-CURRENCY-STK.EXCHANGE`
- **Forex**: `SYMBOL-CURRENCY-CASH.EXCHANGE`
- **Commodities**: `SYMBOL-CURRENCY-CMDTY.EXCHANGE`
- **Futures**: `SYMBOL-CONTRACT_MONTH-CURRENCY-FUT.EXCHANGE`
- **Options on Futures**: `SYMBOL-CONTRACT_MONTH-OPTION_TYPE-STRIKE-CURRENCY-FOP.EXCHANGE`

### 2. Update Exchange Mapping Dictionaries

Ensure that your exchange mappings cover all necessary exchanges used in your symbol definitions.

**Example:**

```python
# Add missing exchanges if necessary
EXCHANGE_VT2IB[Exchange.ISLAND] = "ISLAND"
EXCHANGE_IB2VT["ISLAND"] = Exchange.ISLAND
```

### 3. Generate IB Contracts Correctly

The `generate_ib_contract` function is responsible for creating IB contract objects based on your symbol definitions. Ensure this function correctly interprets the symbol components and maps them to the appropriate IB exchange codes.

**Key Steps in `generate_ib_contract`:**

1. **Split Symbol Components**:

   - Use the delimiter (e.g., `-`) to parse symbol components.

2. **Assign Contract Attributes**:

   - **Symbol**: Assign the base symbol.
   - **SecType**: Assign the security type (`STK`, `FUT`, etc.).
   - **Currency**: Assign the currency code.

3. **Map Exchange Codes**:

   - Use `EXCHANGE_VT2IB` to map internal exchange enums to IB's exchange codes.

4. **Handle Specific Security Types**:

   - **Futures and Options**: Assign additional attributes like `lastTradeDateOrContractMonth`, `right`, and `strike`.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling to catch and log issues during contract generation.

### Example Implementation

```python
def generate_ib_contract(symbol: str, exchange: Exchange) -> Optional[Contract]:
    """Produce IB contract"""
    try:
        fields: list = symbol.split(JOIN_SYMBOL)

        ib_contract: Contract = Contract()
        ib_contract.symbol = fields[0]
        ib_contract.secType = fields[-1]
        ib_contract.currency = fields[-2]

        logging.info(f"Generating IB contract for symbol: {symbol}, exchange: {exchange}")

        if ib_contract.secType == "STK":
            ib_contract.exchange = "SMART"  # Use SMART exchange for routing
            ib_contract.primaryExchange = EXCHANGE_VT2IB[exchange]  # Set primary exchange
        else:
            ib_contract.exchange = EXCHANGE_VT2IB[exchange]

        if ib_contract.secType in ["FUT", "OPT", "FOP"]:
            ib_contract.lastTradeDateOrContractMonth = fields[1]

        if ib_contract.secType == "FUT":
            if len(fields) == 5:
                ib_contract.multiplier = int(fields[2])

        if ib_contract.secType in ["OPT", "FOP"]:
            ib_contract.right = fields[2]
            ib_contract.strike = float(fields[3])
            ib_contract.multiplier = int(fields[4])

        logging.debug(f"Generated IB contract: {ib_contract}")
    except IndexError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error generating IB contract from symbol: {symbol}, Error: {e}")
        ib_contract = None

    return ib_contract
```

### 4. Ensure Comprehensive Exchange Coverage

Make sure that all exchanges used in your symbol definitions are included in the mapping dictionaries. Missing mappings can lead to unrecognized exchanges, causing the error.

**Example:**

```python
# If you encounter an exchange not mapped, add it accordingly
if "NEW_EXCHANGE" not in EXCHANGE_IB2VT:
    EXCHANGE_VT2IB[Exchange.NEW_EXCHANGE] = "NEW_EXCHANGE_CODE"
    EXCHANGE_IB2VT["NEW_EXCHANGE_CODE"] = Exchange.NEW_EXCHANGE
```

### 5. Validate Contracts Before Use

Before sending orders or subscribing to market data, validate that the generated IB contracts are correct and recognized by IB.

**Example Validation:**

```python
def validate_contract(ib_contract: Contract) -> bool:
    """Validate the IB contract by requesting contract details."""
    if ib_contract is None:
        return False
    # Implement contract validation logic, possibly querying IB for confirmation
    return True
```

### Contract Validation Sequence Diagram

Validating contracts before use ensures that only recognized securities are processed. The following sequence diagram outlines this validation process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant VeighNa
    participant InteractiveBrokers

    System->>VeighNa: Generate IB Contract
    VeighNa->>InteractiveBrokers: Request Contract Details
    InteractiveBrokers-->>VeighNa: Return Contract Confirmation
    VeighNa-->>System: Validation Result
    System->>System: Proceed or Handle Error
```

This diagram demonstrates the steps involved in validating a contract with IB before proceeding with trading operations.

## Generating IB Contracts

The `generate_ib_contract` function plays a pivotal role in creating accurate IB contract objects based on your symbol definitions. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

### Function Overview

```python
def generate_ib_contract(symbol: str, exchange: Exchange) -> Optional[Contract]:
    """Produce IB contract"""
    # Implementation as shown above
```

### Parameters:

- **symbol (str)**: The contract symbol in the format `SYMBOL-CURRENCY-PRODUCT_TYPE.EXCHANGE`.
- **exchange (Exchange)**: The internal enum representing the exchange.

### Process:

1. **Parsing Symbol**:

   - Splits the symbol string into components based on the delimiter (e.g., `-`).

2. **Creating IB Contract Object**:

   - Assigns `symbol`, `secType`, and `currency` from the parsed components.

3. **Mapping Exchange**:

   - For stocks (`STK`), sets the exchange to `SMART` for optimal routing and assigns the `primaryExchange` based on mapping.
   - For other security types, directly maps and assigns the appropriate exchange code.

4. **Handling Specific Security Types**:

   - **Futures (`FUT`)**: Assigns `lastTradeDateOrContractMonth` and `multiplier` if applicable.
   - **Options (`OPT`, `FOP`)**: Assigns `right`, `strike`, and `multiplier`.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Catches `IndexError` if the symbol format is incorrect and logs the error.

### Example Usage:

```python
symbol = "ES-202002-USD-FUT"
exchange = Exchange.GLOBEX
ib_contract = generate_ib_contract(symbol, exchange)
if ib_contract:
    # Proceed with using the contract
    pass
else:
    # Handle the error
    pass
```

### Contract Generation Flowchart

To visualize the steps involved in generating an IB contract, consider the following flowchart:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Parse Symbol Components]
    B --> C[Assign Symbol, SecType, Currency]
    C --> D{Is SecType STK?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Set Exchange to SMART]
    D -- No --> F[Map Exchange Using EXCHANGE_VT2IB]
    E --> G[Assign Primary Exchange]
    F --> G
    G --> H{Is SecType FUT, OPT, or FOP?}
    H -- Yes --> I[Assign Additional Attributes]
    H -- No --> J[Finalize Contract]
    I --> J
    J --> K[Log Generated Contract]
    K --> L[End]
```

This flowchart outlines the decision-making process in the `generate_ib_contract` function, ensuring each contract is accurately defined.

## Update Portfolio Method

An essential component of the exchange mapping process is the `updatePortfolio` method. This method ensures that your trading platform accurately reflects your current positions by correctly mapping exchanges and updating portfolio data based on IB's information.

### Understanding the `updatePortfolio` Method

The `updatePortfolio` method is part of the `IbApi` class and is responsible for handling position updates received from IB. Proper implementation of this method ensures that your platform maintains an accurate and up-to-date view of your portfolio.

### Code Snippet

```python
def updatePortfolio(
    self,
    contract: Contract,
    position: float,
    marketPrice: float,
    marketValue: float,
    averageCost: float,
    unrealizedPNL: float,
    realizedPNL: float,
    accountName: str,
) -> None:
    """Position update return"""
    super().updatePortfolio(
        contract,
        position,
        marketPrice,
        marketValue,
        averageCost,
        unrealizedPNL,
        realizedPNL,
        accountName,
    )

    # Map exchange correctly
    exchange_str = contract.exchange or contract.primaryExchange or "SMART"
    exchange: Exchange = EXCHANGE_IB2VT.get(exchange_str, Exchange.SMART)

    if exchange is None:
        msg: str = f"Existence of unsupported exchange positions {generate_symbol(contract)} {contract.exchange} {contract.primaryExchange}"
        logging.error(msg)
        self.gateway.write_log(msg)
        return

    try:
        ib_size: int = int(contract.multiplier)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        ib_size = 1
    price = averageCost / ib_size

    pos: PositionData = PositionData(
        symbol=generate_symbol(contract),
        exchange=exchange,
        direction=Direction.NET,
        volume=position,
        price=price,
        pnl=unrealizedPNL,
        gateway_name=self.gateway_name,
    )
    self.gateway.on_position(pos)
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Method Purpose**:

   - Handles updates to your portfolio positions as reported by IB.
   - Ensures that each position is accurately mapped to the correct exchange.

2. **Exchange Mapping**:

   - **Determine Exchange String**: Retrieves the exchange from the contract. If not available, falls back to `primaryExchange` or defaults to `"SMART"`.
   - **Map to Internal Exchange Enum**: Uses `EXCHANGE_IB2VT` to convert IB's exchange string to the internal `Exchange` enum.
   - **Error Handling**: Logs an error if the exchange is unsupported and halts further processing for that position.

3. **Position Data Calculation**:

   - **Multiplier Handling**: Attempts to convert the contract's multiplier to an integer. Defaults to `1` if conversion fails.
   - **Price Calculation**: Divides the `averageCost` by the multiplier to get the correct price per unit.

4. **Position Object Creation**:

   - **Symbol Generation**: Uses `generate_symbol(contract)` to create a consistent symbol identifier.
   - **Exchange Assignment**: Assigns the correctly mapped exchange.
   - **Direction**: Sets to `Direction.NET` indicating a net position.
   - **Volume and Price**: Assigns the position volume and calculated price.
   - **PnL**: Assigns the unrealized profit and loss (`unrealizedPNL`).
   - **Gateway Name**: Associates the position with the correct gateway.

5. **Updating the Gateway**:
   - Calls `self.gateway.on_position(pos)` to update the platform's internal state with the new position data.

### Importance in Exchange Mapping

The `updatePortfolio` method relies on accurate exchange mapping to:

- **Reflect Correct Positions**: Ensures that your portfolio accurately represents the securities held and their associated exchanges.
- **Facilitate Order Execution**: Correct exchange information is crucial for executing orders related to existing positions.
- **Maintain Data Integrity**: Prevents discrepancies between IB's data and your platform's internal records.

### Sequence Diagram for `updatePortfolio` Method

To better understand the interaction between components during a portfolio update, consider the following sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IB
    participant VeighNa
    participant UpdatePortfolio Method
    participant Internal Database

    IB->>VeighNa: Send Portfolio Update
    VeighNa->>UpdatePortfolio Method: Call updatePortfolio()
    UpdatePortfolio Method->>UpdatePortfolio Method: Map Exchange
    UpdatePortfolio Method->>Internal Database: Update Position Data
    Internal Database-->>UpdatePortfolio Method: Confirmation
    UpdatePortfolio Method->>VeighNa: Notify Position Update
    VeighNa-->>User: Display Updated Portfolio
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of information from receiving a portfolio update from IB to reflecting it in the VeighNa platform.
